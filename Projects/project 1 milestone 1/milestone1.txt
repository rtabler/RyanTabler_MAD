For my first project, I will develop an app to browse the Chinese classic text "Tao Te Ching."

My app will have three tabs. The first tab will let the user browse the book. It will show a collection view with 81 squares, for the 81 short chapters in the book. Once you select a chapter, it will show the user the text.

Since "Tao Te Ching" is a book translated from Chinese, many people translate it in very different ways. In the past, I have found that reading multiple translations simultaneously is very helpful to understanding the text. Hence, once the user is reading a particular chapter, there will be a button in the top right corner to cycle between multiple translations. For the longer chapters, I will maintain the vertical location of the scroll view between different translations.

There will be one more button in the chapter text view: a share button. This will open a menu to allow the user to do a few things. The user will be able to "favorite" a chapter. The user will be able to browse "favorited" chapters in the second tab of the app. The user will also be able to "share" a chapter. Through the "share" menu, you will be able to copy the chapter's text to your clipboard, email the chapter to yourself, or tweet the chapter.

From the chapter selection tab, I would also like to implement a search feature, that allows the user to search for text within the book. The search results will show the chapters that contain the text entered in the search bar. However, I will not consider this feature as part of the MVP.

The last tab of my app will be for settings. Here, the user will be able to choose a few different things:
  * color themes, changing the color of the text and background
  * font family and font size of the text
  * available translations to include in the translation-switching cycle

The bulk of the data needed for my app is the text of the different translations of "Tao Te Ching. To store these, I will first see if it is possible to store and read from simple text files. If that is not possible, I will use Realm. For the user settings and list of "favorited" chapters, I will attempt to use plists first, before switching to Realm.
